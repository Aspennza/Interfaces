Overall, I would consider image manipulation and editing to be neutral concepts that can be used for harmful ends. For instance, image manipulation is widely-used in areas like hobbyist photography, digital art, and graphic design, often without harmful intent or effects. In these areas, image manipulation is simply one of many tools that can be applied to achieve a particular visual effect. However, I would say that image manipulation can certainly be used unethically, most often when it is used with the intent to mislead.
